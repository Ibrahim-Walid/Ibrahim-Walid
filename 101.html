            <h1>Glowing Wind</h1>
            <p>
                At STEM October School, faulty wiring and high electricity costs left many lamp posts non-functional, creating safety concerns for students and staff. To address this issue, our team developed a sustainable solution using wind energy. After careful research, we chose a Savonius Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT) due to its ability to capture wind from any direction and its efficiency in low-wind conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
                We constructed the turbine using recycled materials, including plastic buckets for the blades and a wooden broomstick as the axis. A small DC motor served as a generator, converting wind energy into electricity, which was stored in a lithium-ion battery. Our goal was to generate at least 150 joules of energy in 5 minutes, focusing on affordability, sustainability, and safety.
            </p>
            <p>
                Testing exceeded expectations, with the turbine producing 441 joules in 5 minutes, achieving an efficiency of 17%. This success demonstrated the potential of wind energy in solving our school’s lighting problem.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout the project, we gained practical experience in engineering and teamwork. Moving forward, improvements such as refining the blade design and using stronger materials could further enhance the turbine’s efficiency. We are proud to contribute to a greener and more sustainable school environment.
            </p>
