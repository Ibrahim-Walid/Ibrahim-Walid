            <h1>Aero-pure Tires</h1>
            <p>
                Egypt faces a growing challenge of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, primarily caused by excessive fertilizer use in agriculture. To combat this issue, our team developed an innovative air filtration system using activated carbon derived from waste tires. Our goal was to create a sustainable and cost-effective solution to reduce NOx pollution in agricultural areas like Al-Mena Safour, where emissions are particularly high.
            </p>
            <p>
                After extensive research, we selected waste tires as the raw material due to their availability and potential for conversion into activated carbon through a process involving chemical treatment and pyrolysis. The final prototype consisted of two interlocking containers filled with activated carbon, with a 12V DC air pump ensuring efficient airflow for pollutant adsorption. During testing, the system achieved an 80.81% reduction in NO2 concentration within 8 minutes, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for real-world applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite initial challenges, such as gas leakage and sensor calibration issues, our team made crucial adjustments to improve the system's performance. This project provided us with valuable hands-on experience in engineering, environmental science, and teamwork.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moving forward, we aim to enhance the design by refining the pyrolysis process, exploring alternative materials, and optimizing airflow efficiency to increase the systemâ€™s lifespan and effectiveness. Our project showcases how sustainable engineering solutions can contribute to reducing air pollution and improving public health in agricultural communities.
