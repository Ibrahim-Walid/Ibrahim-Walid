                Egypt faces significant challenges in clean water management, with floods causing damage to communities and resources going untapped. To tackle this issue, our team developed a prototype of a gravity dam tailored to the needs of Qena Valley—a region prone to destructive flash floods. This dam is designed to collect and store floodwaters for future use while reducing flood damage and enhancing water availability.
            </p>
            <p>
                After extensive research, we selected concrete as the primary material due to its durability and cost-effectiveness. The dam's design includes features like a storage capacity of 50–60 liters, flexible water discharge options, and the ability to bear significant loads. Using sand, gravel, cement, and recycled steel for reinforcement, we constructed a durable model. A testing phase confirmed its effectiveness: the dam withstood a 10 kg load, managed controlled water discharge, and maintained a flow rate of 0.9 L/s.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite initial setbacks, such as minor leaks and misaligned components, adjustments ensured the final prototype met our design goals. The project gave us hands-on experience in engineering, problem-solving, and teamwork while addressing a real-world challenge. Moving forward, we aim to refine the design by enhancing materials and optimizing water flow.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project highlights the potential of sustainable engineering solutions in mitigating Egypt’s water challenges, ensuring safety, and contributing to a greener future.
